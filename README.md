### Description

GOTFreak is a site to search for information related to all the characters from the Games of Thrones world. The user can search for a name and obtain all the characters with that name.
For each character selected it will show some extra information like his House, the coat of arms and the culture it belongs.
This is possible thanks to the API made available at: (https://api.got.show/doc/).

We made this excercise at the 4th Week of the Skylab Coders Academy at the end of July 2017.
